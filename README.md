# GRAPHIX-MCO1

The Machine Project involves making an ocean exploration simulator game prototype similar to the game Submarine Commander where the players pilot a submarine and duke it out with the other subs, but our prototype currently does not have any combat involved and includes a third person view of the area similar to the space section in No Man’s Sky. 

General Specifications: 
The game should contain at least 7 different 3D Models that aren’t used in class. 
  o  1 Fully Textured and Normal Mapped Model for the Player’s ship 
  o  6 other models scattered on the map representing the enemy subs. 
Skybox representing the ocean depths. 
Ship can be controlled by the Player to explore your area. 
You can only use the libraries and APIs discussed in class.
